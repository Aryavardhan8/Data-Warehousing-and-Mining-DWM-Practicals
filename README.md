 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains practical implementations from the Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM) course in Semester VI. It covers key concepts such as data preprocessing, OLAP operations, ETL transformations, and machine learning algorithms applied to data mining.

Each practical is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world data challenges.
